# Smooth-Curve-Fitting
Smooth Curve Fitting Genetic Algorithm :Given a set of points,  we would like to fit a curve to them using a  polynomial equation.


# How to run :
1-file contain input (input.txt in this repo) which inputs :

    i-First line: Number of datasets (must be at least 1)
 
    ii-Second line:
    
      â€¢ Number of data points and polynomial degree separated by space
    
    iii-Third line : x-coordinate and y-coordinate separated by space
